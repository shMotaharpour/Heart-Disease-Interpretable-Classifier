# Heart-Disease-Interpretable-Classifier
 An Exploration to find an Interpretable Classifier for Heart Disease dataset with low samples
 
## Introduction
It is important to consider interpretability when building medical ML models. Interpretability refers to the ability to explain or understand the reasoning behind a model's predictions. In the medical field, it is crucial for physicians and other medical professionals to understand the reasoning behind a model's diagnoses or treatment recommendations, as it can have a significant impact on patient care. Additionally, interpretability can help with model validation and identifying potential biases in the data. Overall, interpretability is important in medical ML models as it can improve trust in the model, enhance decision-making and improve patient outcomes.
To practice this concept, I chose a small dataset from the UCI database about [Heart disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).
This dataset has multiple files that I have used [processed.cleveland](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data).

To achieve the goal of this exercise, the presence of heart disease in the patient should be to predict. 
The classic machine learning classification methods will be used.

Results of these models have got compared with metrics such as F1 Score and AUC, and analysis of The ROC curves and Recall-Precision curves.
